# Tableau_IPL-Dashboard🏏🏆
I have created 2 IPL Dashboards using Tableau.
The First one shows the Matches won based on Toss Decision and Toss Decision Based Winnning % along with Title Winner 🏆, Orange cap holder, Purple Cap holder, Tournament 6️⃣ and Touranment 4️⃣ season wise 📅.
And the second one shows Batting and Bowling Stats. 📈📉
